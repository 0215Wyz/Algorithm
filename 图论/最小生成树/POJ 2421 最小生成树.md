【问题描述】<br>
There are N villages, which are numbered from 1 to N, and you should build some roads such that every two villages can connect to each other. We say two village A and B are connected, if and only if there is a road between A and B, or there exists a village C such that there is a road between A and C, and C and B are connected. <br>

We know that there are already some roads between some villages and your job is the build some roads such that all the villages are connect and the length of all the roads built is minimum.<br>

【输入描述】<br>
The first line is an integer N (3 <= N <= 100), which is the number of villages. Then come N lines, the i-th of which contains N integers, and the j-th of these N integers is the distance (the distance should be an integer within [1, 1000]) between village i and village j. <br>

Then there is an integer Q (0 <= Q <= N * (N + 1) / 2). Then come Q lines, each line contains two integers a and b (1 <= a < b <= N), which means the road between village a and village b has been built.<br>

【输出描述】<br>
You should output a line contains an integer, which is the length of all the roads to be built such that all the villages are connected, and this value is minimum.<br>

因为题目直接以邻接矩阵的方式给出数据，所以在对图的储存上，直接选择二维数组，根据题目意思，要修若干条路，将所有的城镇联系在一起，因为有的路已经建成，所以之后可以将二维数组里的对应的位置的值改为0，就可以进行处理了。

```cpp
#pragma warning(disable:4996)

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

const int maxn = 105;
const int inf = 0x3f3f3f3f;

int n, ans;
int map[maxn][maxn];
int d[maxn];
int vis[maxn];

void prim()
{
	int i, j, pos, min;
	for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
	{
		min = inf;
		for (j = 1; j <= n; j++)
		{
			if (!vis[j] && min > d[j])
			{
				min = d[j];
				pos = j;
			}
		}
		if (min == inf)
			return;
		ans += min;
		vis[pos] = 1;
		for (j = 1; j <= n; j++)
		{
			if (!vis[j] && d[j] > map[pos][j])
			{
				d[j] = map[pos][j];
			}
		}
	}
}

int main()
{
	int i, j, q, s, e;
	while (scanf("%d", &n) != EOF)
	{
		for (i = 1; i <= n; i++)
		{
			for (j = 1; j <= n; j++)
			{
				scanf("%d", &map[i][j]);
			}
		}
		scanf("%d", &q);
		fill(vis, vis + maxn, 0);
		while (q--)
		{
			scanf("%d%d", &s, &e);
			map[s][e] = 0;
			map[e][s] = 0;

:smile:Typora真的挺好用的，不过更喜欢分屏的效果​
